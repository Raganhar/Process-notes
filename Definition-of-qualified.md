# Definition of qualified

## **The initiative is well defined**

- The scope and the business case is clear
- The business value is clear
- Define how to measure the expected impact
    - Metrics?
    - BI?
    - Success criterion?

## **The initiative size is reasonable**

- The initiative should be implementable in a single PI.
    - if its too larget it should be split into delivery milestones

## **The initiative has been evaluated**

- The initiative has been SWAGGED. 

## **The initiative priority is identified**

- It is possible to place the initiative in the roadmap relative to other initiatives (prioritization)

## **User flows are created**

- It is clear what personas / user profiles / customers are in question
- User flows are created

## **Impact analysis**

- Impact analysis based on data

- In case the initiative is created based on user feedback, documentation must be provided (e.g. who is the feedback-giver, e-mail correspondence, etc.). This is important, so that it is possible to determine whether the feedback is actually valid (i.e. not just one person) and/or so that it is possible to contact the feedback-giver for additional information. 

## **Wireframes exist (if applicable) - NOTE: not mockups.**

- Business/technical refinement is done based on wireframes. Mockups are created by UX in parallel in the refinement process. The initiative does not fulfill our DoR until mockups are done.
